# Obsidian List Modified

This plugin links all modified files meeting certain criteria to a daily/weekly/monthly note. This provides an accurate log/archive of files modified on certain days.

Example:

Using these settings...

# Usage & Config

Please read [the wiki](https://github.com/franciskafieh/obsidian-list-modified/wiki).


# Why not use Dataview?

- As of now, queries cannot be "frozen" in time (to show as plaintext outside of Obsidian.)
  - This prevents you from easily transferring your logs if you were to ever switch apps
- Queries rely on a file's created/modified property, which does not play well with sync (i.e. the date becomes whenever the file was last synced.)

# Disclaimer

This plugin should not do any harm, but **you should always back up just in case!** I am not responsible for any damage!
