# Obsidian List Modified
This plugin lists all modified files meeting certain criteria to a daily note.

# Why?
As of now, dataview queries cannot be "frozen" in time. There are hacky solutions using templater, but I wanted something really simple.

# How?
When a file is modified, the plugin checks if there is already a link to the modified file inside of your daily note. If not, it appends a link to the daily note.

# Criteria supported
- date
- tags

# Usage
TODO
